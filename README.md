number_slide_puzzle
===================

creating and playing a number puzzle on the command line.

And now it's time to play. The Game of Fifteen is a puzzle played on a square, two-dimensional board with numbered tiles that slide. The goal of this puzzle is to arrange the board's tiles from smallest to largest, left to right, top to bottom, with an empty space in board's bottom-right corner.

at the command line, you run the program along with a number. that number generates the size of the board's width and height. So if you give run the program with and specify the number 3, the board will be 3 tiles wide by 3 tiles high essentially holding 9 tiles across the board. If number given is an odd number, tiles 1 and 2 switch locations upon generation. If the number is even, tiles 1 and 2 are generated in descending sequence.

Object of the game is to get the numbers in ascending order starting from the top left of the board and ending on the bottom right. there are an unlimited amount of moves, just get the board flipped around completely and you win.

This program was configured for the purpose of solving a problem set from an EDX course.
